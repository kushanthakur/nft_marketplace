# NFT Marketplace
## Project Overview

This project aims to create a platform based on ERC721 token standard where users can tokenize their assets (paintings) and sell them as NFTs. The platform will allow anyone to list their paintings for sale and buyers to purchase them using cryptocurrency. Once a painting is sold, an NFT will be minted and ownership of that NFT will be transferred to the buyer.

## Functionality
### The platform will have the following functionality:

- List a painting for sale: Any user can come to the platform and list their painting for sale. They will need to provide details such as the title, description, and price.


- Buy a painting: Buyers can come to the platform, browse through the available paintings, and purchase the one they want using cryptocurrency.


- Tokenize the painting: Once a painting is sold, an NFT will be minted for that particular asset and ownership of that NFT will be transferred to the buyer.

- View functions: Users can view the list of available paintings for sale, the details of a particular painting, and the ownership history of an NFT.

## Technology Used

### The platform will be built using the following technologies:

- Solidity - for smart contract development
- Remix IDE - for building the user interface
- Ganache - for local development and testing
- MetaMask - for interacting with the blockchain
